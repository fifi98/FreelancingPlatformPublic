# Freelancing Platform Website
A website which allows freelancers to find jobs that are posted by employers. The logic is as following: both employer and freelancer register to the website. Employer can post jobs and determine its budget range to which freelancers can bid. Employers can see the project bids and decide who they want to hire. When hireing a freelancer, employer has to pay a deposit fee which is defined in the admin panel (e.g. 20%). Upon job completion the employer pays the remaining price for the job completion.
